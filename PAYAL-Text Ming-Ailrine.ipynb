Use this data set to see if you can predict the cost of a bird strike (i.e., the `Total Cost` column in the data set) based on the attributes of the incident. This is important because this model can make a cost prediction as soon as a bird strike incident happens."

    "* This assignment requires you to work with a text-based column in addition to regular numeric/categorical columns. So you will have to pay attention to your pipelines during data processing.\n",
    "* You can do your data prep before or after the train/test split. Regardless, you should use train_test_split only once. If you find yourself using it twice, it means you are doing something wrong.\n",
    "* Recommended approach: \n",
    "    * import the data and perform the train/test split - like we always do. \n",
    "    * identify the names of numeric, categorical, feature engineered, and text columns - like we always do\n",
    "    * create individual pipelines for each type of column - like we always do. For the text pipeline, I would recommend the TFIDF Vectorizer with SVDs. Though, you can also use TFIDF Vectorizer with top N terms (without SVDs).\n",
